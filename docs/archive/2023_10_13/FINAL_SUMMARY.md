## 🔑 Key Technical Details

### Day Numbering
```typescript
// Frontend (Your UI):
1 = Monday
2 = Tuesday
3 = Wednesday
4 = Thursday
5 = Friday
6 = Saturday
7 = Sunday ← Your system

// Database (Automatic conversion):
const jsDay = dayNumber === 7 ? 0 : dayNumber;
// Converts: 7 → 0, keeps 1-6 same
// Database still uses: 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday
```

### Smart Button Logic
```typescript
// Checks if 22+ days scheduled in next 4 weeks (80% coverage)
if (hasSchedulesFor4Weeks) {
  // Shows: "Update Schedule" button (green)
} else {
  // Shows: "Generate New Schedule & Time Slots" button (blue)
}
```

### Week Navigation
```typescript
// Limited to 4 weeks (0, 1, 2, 3)
currentWeekOffset: 0 → Week 1 (current week)
currentWeekOffset: 1 → Week 2 (next week)
currentWeekOffset: 2 → Week 3 (2 weeks ahead)
currentWeekOffset: 3 → Week 4 (3 weeks ahead)
```

### Dashboard Header:
- [ ] Profile image shows (or initials)
- [ ] Doctor name displays
- [ ] Specialty shows
- [ ] Email displays
- [ ] Last login time shows

### Schedule Form:
- [ ] Week navigation works (1-4)
- [ ] Can't go before Week 1
- [ ] Can't go after Week 4
- [ ] Past dates are gray
- [ ] Today has blue badge
- [ ] Can check/uncheck days
- [ ] Time inputs work
- [ ] Slot duration dropdown works
- [ ] Break time inputs work
- [ ] Copy-to buttons work

### Buttons:
- [ ] Right button shows (Update OR Generate)

- [ ] Success message shows
- [ ] Error messages display

### Critical:
- [ ] Sunday (day 7) saves correctly

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Compatibility
- ✅ **100% compatible** with your current database
- ✅ No migration needed
- ✅ Day 7 auto-converts to 0 when saving
- ✅ Existing schedules load correctly

### Profile Image
- If you have `profile_image_url` → Shows image
- If no image → Shows initials automatically
- Initials skip "Dr" prefix (Dr. John Smith → JS)

### 4-Week Logic
- Counts unique scheduled dates in 28-day period
- Needs 22+ days (80% coverage) to show "Update"
- Accounts for weekends/days off
- First time: Use "Generate" button
- After that: Use "Update" button

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Sunday Not Saving
**Check:** Line ~280 has conversion logic
```typescript
const jsDay = dayNumber === 7 ? 0 : dayNumber;
```

### Problem: Update Button Not Appearing
**Reason:** Less than 22 days scheduled
**Solution:** Normal! Use "Generate" first

### Problem: Can't Edit Week 5
**This is correct!** Designed for 4 weeks only

### Problem: Profile Image Missing
**Reason:** No `profile_image_url` in database
**Fallback:** Shows initials (this is normal)
