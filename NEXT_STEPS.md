## 🚀 How to Switch to Merged Version

### Option 1: Quick Swap (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Backup your current file (just in case)
mv src/pages/DoctorDashboardPage.tsx src/pages/DoctorDashboardPage_BACKUP.tsx

# 2. Make merged file the active one
mv src/pages/DoctorDashboardPage_Merged.tsx src/pages/DoctorDashboardPage.tsx

# 3. Optional: Clean up the PDF reference file later
# (Keep it for now as reference)
```

### Option 2: Manual Rename (In File Explorer)
1. Go to `src/pages/` folder
2. Rename `DoctorDashboardPage.tsx` → `DoctorDashboardPage_BACKUP.tsx`
3. Rename `DoctorDashboardPage_Merged.tsx` → `DoctorDashboardPage.tsx`
4. Done!

## 🔍 Key Changes to Understand

### 1. Day Numbering is STILL 1-7
```typescript
// Frontend (Your form):
Day 1 = Monday
Day 2 = Tuesday
...
Day 7 = Sunday ← This is YOUR system

// Database (Automatic conversion):
When saving day 7 → Converts to 0 (JS Sunday)
const jsDay = dayNumber === 7 ? 0 : dayNumber;
```

**Result:** Your database structure remains unchanged!

### 2. Smart Button Logic
```typescript
// If you have 22+ days scheduled in next 4 weeks:
Shows "Update Schedule" button (green)

// If you DON'T have 22+ days scheduled:
Shows "Generate New Schedule & Time Slots" button (blue)
```

### 3. Week Navigation
- **Week 1** = Current week
- **Week 2** = Next week
- **Week 3** = 2 weeks ahead
- **Week 4** = 3 weeks ahead
- Previous button disabled at Week 1
- Next button disabled at Week 4

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Compatibility
- ✅ Merged file is 100% compatible with your current database
- ✅ Day 7 automatically converts to 0 when saving
- ✅ No data migration needed
- ✅ Existing schedules will load correctly

### Profile Image
If you don't have `profile_image_url` in your database:
- Shows initials instead (automatic fallback)
- Skips "Dr" prefix if present
- Uses gradient background

### Week Offset
The merged file checks:
```typescript
// Can't have more than 22 unique dates in 28-day period
hasSchedulesFor4Weeks = uniqueDates.size >= 22
```
This is 80% coverage (accounts for weekends/days off)

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: Sunday (Day 7) Not Saving
**Solution:** Check the conversion logic at line ~280:
```typescript
const jsDay = dayNumber === 7 ? 0 : dayNumber;
```

### Problem: Update Button Not Showing
**Reason:** You don't have 22+ days scheduled yet
**Solution:** Use "Generate" button first to create 4-week schedule

### Problem: Can't Navigate Past Week 4
**This is correct!** The merged file limits to 4 weeks as designed in PDF

### Problem: Profile Image Not Loading
**Check:** Database has `profile_image_url` field in `doctors` table
**Fallback:** Shows initials automatically if image missing

## 📝 What to Do Right Now

### Immediate Action:
```bash
# Just do this:
1. Rename DoctorDashboardPage.tsx → DoctorDashboardPage_BACKUP.tsx
2. Rename DoctorDashboardPage_Merged.tsx → DoctorDashboardPage.tsx
3. Test in browser
4. If works: Delete backup after a few days
5. If issues: Rename backup back
```

### Files to Keep:
- ✅ `DoctorDashboardPage.tsx` (the merged one, after rename)
- ✅ `DoctorDashboardPage_BACKUP.tsx` (your original, for safety)
- ❓ `DoctorDashboardPage_Cleaned.tsx` (optional, just reference)

### Files to Delete Later (After Testing):
- `DoctorDashboardPage_BACKUP.tsx` (once merged works)
- `DoctorDashboardPage_Cleaned.tsx` (PDF reference, not needed)
