## Issues Identified & Solutions

### Issue 1: File Uploads Not Working
**Problem:** Documents not uploading to buckets, URLs are blank

**Root Cause:** 
1. Storage buckets don't exist
2. No RLS policies for patient buckets
3. File upload happening before patient record creation

**Solution:**
1. Run migration `20251014000002_create_patient_storage_buckets.sql` to create buckets
2. Fixed upload order in code (create patient → upload files → update patient with URLs)

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Run this migration in Supabase SQL Editor
supabase/migrations/20251014000002_create_patient_storage_buckets.sql
```

### Issue 2: Appointment Creation Not Working
**Problem:** Appointments not being created in appointments table

**Root Cause:**
1. Patient profile not created before appointment
2. Wrong patient ID being used
3. Missing error handling

**Solution:**
1. Ensure patient profile is created first
2. Use patientProfile.id instead of user.id
3. Added proper error handling and logging

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in code

### Issue 3: Confirm Appointment Button Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking button does nothing

**Root Cause:**
1. User not authenticated
2. Missing booking details
3. Component not handling auth success properly

**Solution:**
1. Added auth check
2. Redirect to login if not authenticated
3. Handle auth success in useEffect

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in code

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Create Storage Buckets
Run this migration to create the necessary storage buckets:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251014000002_create_patient_storage_buckets.sql
```

### Step 2: Refactor Tables (Optional - Only if you want to clean up schema)
Run this migration to streamline the table structure:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251014000001_refactor_patient_registration_safe.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify Storage Buckets
Check that the following buckets exist:
- `lab-reports` (private)
- `aadhaar-documents` (private)
- `profile_image` (public)

## Testing Checklist
