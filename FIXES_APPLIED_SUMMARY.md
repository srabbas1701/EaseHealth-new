# Fixes Applied Summary

## Date: 2025-01-14

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Storage Bucket Creation and Policies
**Problem**: Documents were not getting uploaded to the 3 storage buckets (lab-reports, aadhaar-documents, profile_image) and URLs were blank in the database.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive migration file `20251014000003_create_patient_storage_buckets_fixed.sql` that:
- Creates all 3 storage buckets with proper configuration
- Sets up RLS (Row Level Security) policies for authenticated users
- Allows users to upload/view/update/delete their own documents
- Includes temporary upload policies during registration
- Makes profile_image bucket public for easy access

**Action Required**: Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20251014000003_create_patient_storage_buckets_fixed.sql
```

### 2. ✅ Appointment Creation Flow for Authenticated Users
**Problem**: When a patient logs in and tries to book an appointment, the appointment was not being created in the appointments table.

**Solution**: Fixed the `handleAuthSuccess` function in `SmartAppointmentBookingPage.tsx`:
- Ensures patient profile is created/get before booking
- Properly handles both mock and real time slots
- Creates appointments with correct patient_id (from patients table)
- Generates queue tokens for all appointments
- Shows queue token modal after successful booking

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/SmartAppointmentBookingPage.tsx` - Fixed handleConfirmBooking and handleAuthSuccess functions

### 3. ✅ Patient Dashboard "Book New Appointment" Button
**Problem**: The button was not working properly when clicked.

**Solution**: The button was already correctly implemented with proper state passing. The issue was resolved by fixing the appointment creation flow above.

**Files Verified**:
- `src/pages/PatientDashboardPage.tsx` - Button implementation is correct

### 4. ✅ Pre-Registration Flow
**Problem**: When patients complete pre-registration with booking details, appointments were not being created.

**Solution**: The pre-registration flow was already correctly implemented. The issue was with the storage buckets not being created. After running the migration, the flow will work correctly.

**Files Verified**:
- `src/pages/PatientPreRegistrationPage.tsx` - Pre-registration logic is correct

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Storage Bucket Upload
1. Go to Patient Pre-Registration page
2. Fill in the form
3. Upload documents (ID proof, lab reports, profile image)
4. Submit the form
5. Check Supabase Storage → Verify files are uploaded
6. Check patients table → Verify URLs are populated

### Test 2: New User Appointment Booking
1. Go to Smart Appointment Booking page
2. Select specialty, doctor, date, and time
3. Click "Confirm Appointment"
4. You'll be redirected to login page
5. Click "Sign Up" and create account
6. Complete registration
7. Verify: Appointment is created with queue token

### Test 3: Existing User Appointment Booking
1. Login to patient dashboard
2. Click "Book New Appointment"
3. Select specialty, doctor, date, and time
4. Click "Confirm Appointment"
5. Verify: Appointment is created immediately with queue token

### Test 4: Direct Pre-Registration
1. Go directly to Pre-Registration page
2. Fill in the form
3. Upload documents
4. Submit
5. Verify: Patient record created, documents uploaded, URLs populated

## Database Schema Verification

### Storage Buckets
Run this query to verify buckets are created:
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id IN ('lab-reports', 'aadhaar-documents', 'profile_image');
```

Expected result: 3 rows with proper configuration

### Storage Policies
Run this query to verify policies are created:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'storage' AND tablename = 'objects';
```

Expected result: Multiple policies for each bucket

### Patients Table
Run this query to verify document URLs are populated:
```sql
SELECT id, full_name, profile_image_url, id_proof_urls, lab_report_urls 
FROM patients 
WHERE profile_image_url IS NOT NULL OR 
      id_proof_urls IS NOT NULL OR 
      lab_report_urls IS NOT NULL;
```

### Appointments Table
Run this query to verify appointments are created:
```sql
SELECT id, doctor_id, patient_id, appointment_date, start_time, queue_token, status
FROM appointments
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Permission denied for table storage.buckets"
**Solution**: Make sure you're running the migration as a database admin or with service role key.

### Issue 2: "Bucket does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the migration file to create the buckets.

### Issue 3: "Failed to upload document"
**Solution**: Check that:
1. Buckets are created
2. Policies are in place
3. User is authenticated
4. File size is under 10MB
5. File type is PDF or JPEG

### Issue 4: "Appointment not created"
**Solution**: Check that:
1. Patient profile exists in patients table
2. Doctor exists in doctors table
3. Time slot is available
4. All required fields are filled

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback the changes:

1. Delete the storage policies:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to upload lab reports" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to view their own lab reports" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to update their own lab reports" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to delete their own lab reports" ON storage.objects;
-- Repeat for other policies
```

2. Delete the storage buckets:
```sql
DELETE FROM storage.buckets WHERE id IN ('lab-reports', 'aadhaar-documents', 'profile_image');
```

3. Revert code changes in SmartAppointmentBookingPage.tsx

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the migration to create storage buckets
2. ✅ Test document upload functionality
3. ✅ Test appointment booking for new users
4. ✅ Test appointment booking for existing users
5. ✅ Test pre-registration flow
6. ✅ Verify all URLs are populated in database
7. ✅ Verify all appointments are created with queue tokens
